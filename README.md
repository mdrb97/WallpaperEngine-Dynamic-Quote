# WallpaperEngine-Dynamic-Quote
Wallpaper Engine dynamic quote string to be used in Scene type wallpapers (SceneScript)

This uses an array with quotes from https://github.com/JamesFT/Database-Quotes-JSON (a quote was added to this).

This will choose a random quote from the array and display them using 2 textfields in a scene. The quote itself will be moved to the right, and the author text will be moved to the left.

The author text will be offset from the quote text (in the bottom right of it, to be exact).

## Example
